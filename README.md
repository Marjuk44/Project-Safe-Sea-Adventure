Clean a messy data set known as “Shark Attacks” and build a project through fetching important insights.

## Overview
Preparing the data set for analysis and for a use case. Understanding its structure and formulating a hypothesis or several hypotheses about the data. Following the hypothesis come up with business case. 

## Preparation

### Phase 1:
- Download the dataset and import it into Python.
- Examine the data and try to understand what the fields mean before proceeding with data cleaning and manipulation.
- Analyze the structure and quality of a dataset, identify potential issues or problems, and develop a plan for cleaning and transforming the data.

### Phase 2:
- Removing the columns (15-23)
- Choosing a timeframe of 1980 - 2024
- Dropping null values
- Dropping duplicates
- Dropping rows with missing dates or locations
- Converting the data type date to datetime

### Phase 3:
- Standardizing Data Entries: Normalize attack types (Provoked / Unprovoked)
- Normalize sex categories
- Visualize distribution of shark attacks by year
- Finding top 5 beaches to avoid
- Top 5 beaches prone to minimal shark attack
- Visualization of attack types
- A chart to see the time of the day when the attack mostly occured

# Business Case
- Partnering with Sharkbanz
- Different safe sea adventure packages (detail on the presentation)
